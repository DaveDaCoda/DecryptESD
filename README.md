# DecryptESD
Remove encryption from the ESD files distributed through the Windows Store infrastructure with DecryptESD.

DecryptESD currently targets .NET Framework 4.5.2, allowing it to be used back to Windows Vista SP2. I've not tested compatibility with Mono, but I don't evisage there being an issue, given that it's a self-contained assembly with no dependencies beyond the .NET Framework itself. I also plan to take it to .NET Core and test it on OS X and Linux.

## Current State
* ESDs are decrypted successfully, both pre-14361 and post-14361.
* ESDs will be almost identical byte-for-byte to esddecrypt output - the only differences will be due to DecryptESD dropping indentation in the XML data, which is what DISM does.
* XML and Integrity tables are corrected after decryption

## Future plans
* Unit testing is probably a good idea and entirely implementable
* .NET Core support - include testing on OS X and Linux
* Extend functionality
* Localise into other languages
* oh, and error handling is probably pretty important too.
